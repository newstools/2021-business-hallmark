Idowu Olakunle The Ogun State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality, Human Rights Violations and Extra Judicial Killings says it has concluded its assignment. Chairman of the panel, Justice Solomon Olugbemi who made this known in Abeokuta, explained that the panel received a total of 106 petitions, out of which it treated 58 within six months of its assignment. He added that the remaining 48 were either withdrawn, rejected or abandoned wholly or half-way by the petitioners. “Some of the petitions were rejected because they were not in line with the terms of reference that the Panel was given by the government,” he said. The Chairman assured all petitioners and respondents of justice without fear or favour, as the panel’s report is ready for submission to government while he revealed that after submission, it is left for government to implement the report or not. Speaking on some of the challenges faced by the Panel, the Chairman said, “although the panel encountered some logistics challenges but it was able to surmount them.” It would be recalled that the Panel was inaugurated on October 19, 2020 by Governor Dapo Abiodun and was given a six month period to receive and investigate petitions from members of the public whose human rights have been violated and abused by security personnel within the State and also to make appropriate recommendations to government.
