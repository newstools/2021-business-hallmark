There is no way you can ever be forgotten, you have served this state very well with the most active part of your lives and the state will forever be grateful to you. “We recognize your past efforts for the growth and development of our dear state and so it will be disheartening for any government to neglect your welfare. Just as the Oyetola administration has been doing from the onset, your welfare still remains top priority for this government. “I can assure you that the administration will continue to put you first like we have always done, your welfare is as important as that of the active workers because if not for your service we won’t be where we are today, Governor Oyetola will never neglect your welfare.”
