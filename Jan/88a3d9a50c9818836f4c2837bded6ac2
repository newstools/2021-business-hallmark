Nigeria’s federal government is reportedly making plans to concession 12 highways, which may herald the return of tollgates. The Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, will today receive the Outline Business Case Certificate of Compliance for the 12 pilot federal highways billed for concession under the ministry’s Highway Development Management Initiative. PUNCH gathered that the 12 highways combined represent about 1,963km and less than 5.6 per cent of Nigeria’s 35,000km federal highway network. The 12 routes of the pilot phase include Benin-Asaba, Abuja-Lokoja, Kano-Katsina, Onitsha-Owerri, Shagamu-Benin and Abuja-Keffi-Akwanga. Others include Kano-Shuari and Potiskum-Damaturu, Lokoja-Benin, Enugu-Port Harcourt, Ilorin-Jebba, Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta, and Lagos-Badagry-Seme border. A document on the objectives of the HDMI stated that the initiative would attract sustainable investment/funding in the development of road infrastructure. It said the HDMI would maximise the use of assets along the right-of-way and develop other highway furniture. The HDMI, according to the ministry, targets to develop an ecosystem along the federal highway network by bringing multi-dimensional resources of skills, finance, technology and efficiency into national highway governance. It stated that the home-grown initiative would become the lasting solution to the development, management and maintenance of Nigeria’s 35,000km federal highways.
