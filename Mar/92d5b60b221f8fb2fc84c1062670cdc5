Nigerians have taken to social media to express outrage over the decision of the federal government to hike price of petrol to N212 per litre, with many raising concerns for the country’s impoverished households. The fuel pricing regulator, Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) had in a template released on Thursday night, said that a litre of fuel would now be sold for prices ranging from N209 to N212 per litre for March. This was against N186 the crucial commodity retailed for in February. The PPPRA said the landing cost of petrol in March would be N189.61 per litre as against N163.74 in February. The PPPRA has been setting guidelines for petrol sales since the Buhari administration announced partial deregulation of the oil sector, but the government maintains control of policies that determine ultimate retail costs. The new hikes surprisingly came barely a day after President Muhammadu Buhari promised to return fuel price to below N100 for Nigerians. Also on March 1, the NNPC issued a statement in which it categorically told Nigerians that there would be no new hikes. The state-owned firm said the government has enough fuel in the dump to last Nigerians for several weeks, urging citizens to desist from hoarding or panic-buying. Mr. Buhari met the price at N87 per litre when he assumed office in 2015.
Following the development, many Nigerians have taken to social media to express outrage, with #FuelPriceHike already trending at number one on social media platform, Twitter. “Food prices before now have been out of reach for many Nigerians then you add #FuelPriceHike on top of it which will further drive up prices of things across board,” lamented a user Aproko Doctor @aproko_doctor. “Yet, the average Nigerian’s earning has not increased. How exactly do we want to bring people out of poverty?

Salary remains same. Even many businesses aren’t doing any better before talking of salary increase.” . So saddening. Rent, food, cloths, fuel everything gone so high. Salary remains same.
