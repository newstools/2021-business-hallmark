This is 2021 how do we go about this?” Adegboye said although the present government under the leadership of governor Adegboyega Oyetola has tried in alleviating the suffering of the pensioners, most especially the contributory pensioners unlike the last regime, but like Oliver twist they were asking for more. Adegboye noted that the Oyetola administration has since November 2018, has paid N3.3 billion out of the arears of salary that his precessor accumulated, adding that it would be pleasant if he could jack up the monthly payment to N2billion. He thanked the governor for putting into consideration, the welfare of the pensioners in the state, but urged him to double his efforts in making life meaningful for the old people. Adegboye also appealed to the pensioners in the state to take things easy and take good care of themselves in order to live long, saying the soul that is alive will lay claim to his or her entitlements .
