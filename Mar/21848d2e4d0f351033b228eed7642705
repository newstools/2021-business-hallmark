There was a rowdy session at the Nigerian Senate was on Wednesday as senators bitterly disagreed during a debate on the establishment of an Armed Forces Service Commission. The lawmakers were sharply divided over the bill which proposes to establish an Armed Forces Service Commission which was sponsored by Senate Minority leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe. Among other things, the the Armed Forces Services Commission seeks to ensure that the composition/appointment of Service Chiefs of the Armed Forces of the Federation reflects the Federal Character of Nigeria in the manner prescribed in section 217 (3) of the 1999 Constitution. However, those against the bill argued that it will cause more disunity in the country. Abaribe, nonetheless, insisted that the constitution mandates the National Assembly to set up the commission. The bill was later rejected during a voice vote and Senator Abaribe called for a division â€“ that is lawmakers should vote individually, following which the Senate later went into a closed-door session. After the closed-door session, Senate President Ahmed Lawan said the entire Senate has appealed to the Minority Leader, Senator Abaribe to withdraw Order 73 which called for a division. Senator Abaribe then withdrew the bill to represent it another day after consultation. Key highlights in the bill include: The Bill seeks to establish the Armed Forces Services Commission to ensure that the composition/appointment of Service Chiefs of the Armed Forces of the Federation reflects the Federal Character of Nigeria in the manner prescribed in section 217 (3) of the 1999 Constitution.
