The Lagos State Government has announced it will shutdown Falomo Bridge for 6 weeks with effect from Sunday, March 14, 2021. This, according to it, follows the approval secured from the Federal Government for repair works on the bridge which will be completed on April 30, 2021. The state commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde who made the disclosure on Friday said that the repair work will run on a 24hours shift in phases to enable the contractor complete repairs within the estimated time and minimize the expected inconveniences on the road users. The commissioner explained that the first stage of the repairs will cover the Victoria Island-bound lane of the bridge, which will be closed to traffic, adding that motorists heading towards Victoria Island will be diverted to the Ikoyi bound lanes to create a counter-flow. According to him, while the Ikoyi bound lane will be closed down for the second stage of rehabilitation works, in a similar fashion, motorists will be diverted to other lanes. He assured that sufficient signage would be put up to guide motorists as well as traffic management personnel deployed to help motorists navigate their ways home with ease. Oladeinde appealed to the good people of the State to cooperate with the Government by complying with the directives and traffic advisory to allow contractors to finish the projects in record time.
