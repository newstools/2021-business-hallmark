Don’t drag our reputation to disrepute, Army warns Sheikh Gumi By OBINNA EZUGWU The Nigerian Army has warned popular Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi against dragging its reputation to disrepute with his incendiary comments. The Army in a statement issued on Monday titled, ‘Nigerian Army Does Not Deploy Its Troops Along Ethnic Or Religious Lines’, said contrary to Gumi’s statements to bandits recently that Christian soldiers were the ones killing the bandits, the Army does not deploy troops along religious or ethnic lines. The statement which was signed by Director, Army Public Relations, Mohammed Yerima said, “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a viral video-clip showing the renowned and respected Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi, alleging that non-Muslim soldiers were responsible for the attacks against bandits. “In the video clip, the Islamic scholar was seen telling the bandits that the soldiers involved in most attacks against them were non-Muslims. He further stated that they should be aware that soldiers are divided into Muslims and non-Muslims. “While the Nigerian Army would not want to join issues with the respected Sheikh Ahmed Gumi, it is, however, important to restate that the Nigerian Army as national institution, does not deploy its troops along ethnic or religious lines. “Therefore, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi and other opinion merchants are please enjoined to exercise restraint not to drag the image and reputation of one of the most reliable national institutions to disrepute. “The Nigerian Army remains the pride of the nation and has continually defended the territorial integrity of this great nation. Comments suggesting to mudslide the image and reputation of the Nigerian Army are not only inimical but tended towards creating bad blood amongst Nigerians. “Furthermore, most operations conducted by the Nigerian Army were done in strict adherence to rules of engagement, code of conduct and respect for the fundamental human rights of the citizenry without any exception. It is therefore, disturbing that an opinion leader would deliberately want to disparage the Nigerian Army to portray it in bad light. “The Nigerian Army wishes to seize this opportunity to advise opinion leaders to be more courteous while expressing their views, taking into cognisance the imperative for national security, particularly at this difficult times when our gallant troops have redoubled their efforts to tackle the myriads of security challenges facing our dear nation. What our troops need now is public support to discharge their responsibility effectively and in the most professional manner." <img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/hallmarknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/images-85.jpeg?resize=640%2C640&#038;ssl=1" alt="" title="images-85-jpeg" width="640" height="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51580" data-recalc-dims="1" />
