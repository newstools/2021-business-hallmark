The Nigerian Army has declared a total of 12 officers and 89 soldiers wanted for deserting the war front after Boko Haram terrorists attacked Marte and Dikwa local governments in Borno State. The army authorities have also frozen the banks accounts of the affected personnel. It was learnt that the soldiers absconded from their duty posts after insurgents attacked their camps in Marte and Dikwa with superior weapons and firepower, leaving several of their colleagues dead. Reports say at least seven soldiers were confirmed dead after Boko Haram terrorists attacked Marte. The soldiers, attached to the 15 Task Force Battalion, were ambushed and dislodged by the insurgents after hours of intense fighting. Those familiar with the incident told Premium Times that the troops were overwhelmed and could not withstand the superior firepower of the terrorists. The unit then tactically retreated and relocated to Dikwa, which was attacked again. The Nigerian Army recently announced the recovery of Marte and other communities. Order to apprehend deserters
Military insiders said the order to arrest and freeze bank accounts of the fleeing soldiers came from authorities of Operation Lafiya Dole in Borno. Various formations of the army have been notified to immediately apprehend and deliver any of the soldiers found in their areas of responsibilities. An internal memo to that effect has already been circulated to various formations, our sources said. Full list of the officers and soldiers who deserted the army: 1. EP Nwangwu
