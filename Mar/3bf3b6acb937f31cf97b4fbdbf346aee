According to him, the Bill seeks to promote and provide for finance to support agriculture development in the country in order to ensure food production and food security in Nigeria. He noted that it was an already acknowledged fact that the major bane of agricultural sector in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa was inadequate funding. He added: “To date, Nigeria is yet to fully implement the 2003 Maputo declaration on Agriculture requiring states, parties to allocate ten per cent of its national budget for agricultural development. “If this was done, agriculture research and development, food production and food security would have witnessed a major leap.”
