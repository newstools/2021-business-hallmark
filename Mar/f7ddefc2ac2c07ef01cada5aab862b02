A bill for a law to provide life pension for former governors and deputy governors of Enugu has scaled through the first reading at the State House of Assembly The Executive bill, which was presented for first reading during the plenary in Enugu on Thursday, sought to provide pension for the governor and his deputy after serving their tenure in office, NAN reported. The piece of legislation would make a former governor or deputy governor entitled to gratuity as well as pension for life at the expense of the state government. The bill also made provision for medical allowance not exceeding N12m per annum for one surviving spouse, provided that such spouse was married to the governor while in office. While the state government would provide adequate security for the former governors for their lifetime, the bill, when passed, would also mandate the state government to provide three vehicles for the ex-governor and replace them every four years. “A person who had held office as elected governor or deputy governor in Enugu State or any other state should be entitled to pension for life. “The entitlement to the pension should be provided that such a person was not removed from office by the process of impeachment. “When a former governor or former deputy governor dies, the state government should make adequate arrangement and bear the financial responsibility for his burial. “The state government should pay a condolence allowance of a sum equivalent to the annual basic salary of the incumbent to his next of kin.
