OBINNA EZUGWU The leaders of the South East geopolitical zone have reaffirmed their commitment to the sustenance of a united Nigeria where there is justice, equity and equality of all Nigerians. The leaders stated this today after their meeting with representatives of the Federal Government held at the Government House, Enugu. Speaking through the Chairman of the South East Governorsâ€™ Forum, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, the South East leaders stated clearly that the people of the South East are not disposed to secession from Nigeria because no other tribe has demonstrated belief and commitment to the unity of the country more than our people.
