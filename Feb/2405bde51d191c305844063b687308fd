President of African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), Benedict Oramah and Senior director of the Africa Investment Forum (AIF), Chinelo Anohu have been named as panelists at the Africa Soft Power series. The series themed, ‘The new face of African collaboration’, will hosted by the Africa Soft Power Project and will focus on the evolution of infrastructure development on the continent. The other panelists are Wamkele Mene, secretary-general of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA); and Dean Garfield, Vice President of public policy at Netflix. The virtual event is scheduled to hold on February 23, 2021, by 6pm. The host said Africa’s global standing has improved with the emergence of Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the first woman and first African leader of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) — especially at a time when the AfCFTA offers significant transformative opportunities for the continent. “The session provides a veritable platform to explore the evolution of infrastructure development on the continent (including digital), whilst contextualising the strategic value of expanded trade opportunities to economic advancement and cultural integration in Africa,” the statement read. “The discussion will also explore how legacy reputation issues have hindered Africa’s investment opportunities on the world stage, and how this is now being remedied through soft power plays, as well as physical and digital infrastructure investment.”
