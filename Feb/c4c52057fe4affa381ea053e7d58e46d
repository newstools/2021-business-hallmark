At the meeting, Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the impact of COVID-19 pandemic forced all countries to cut down production to control price. “At the peak of Covid-19, we made 12 million barrel per day, and NNPC contribution maintained the price of petrol at N162 – N163 since September. “We can avoid subsiding regime because it has its collateral impact so government cannot sustain it.” At the end of the meeting, council resolved to come up with idea that addresses people’s concern, and meet with the relevant stakeholder who will come up with a plan that soften the effect of regulation in terms of social security.
