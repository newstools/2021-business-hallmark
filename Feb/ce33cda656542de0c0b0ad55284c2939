Adebayo Obajemu Wema Bank has launched a ‘14 Days of Love with 945’ promo to make this season of love eventful for customers. The two-week promo will see the bank give away goody bags, airtime and even data bonuses to bring the spirit of love, good cheer and fun to all this season. The social media campaign, slated for February 5 to 18, 2021, aims to encourage new and existing customers to transact and pay bills with the *945# string codes for a chance to win prizes. The promo will test customers’ knowledge of various *945# USSD codes, wit and creativity in developing loved-themed messages and videos around the codes, among others. Head, Brand and Marketing Communications, Wema Bank, Funmilayo Falola said: “The *945# sting codes represent the ease and simplicity of banking that we offer our customers. Plugging into this festivity of love, we intend to remind our Wema Bank family that not only do we care for their ease of banking, but their general welfare and happiness is a concern of ours, hence the gift and goodies attached to this campaign.” Even as customers go about transacting with the *945# string codes this season, hoping to claim one prize or the other, the bank encourages them to maintain COVID-19 safety guidelines and show love, not just to family and friends but to themselves as well
