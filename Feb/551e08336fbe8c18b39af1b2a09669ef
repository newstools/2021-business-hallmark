The incident, according to reports, occurred around 3 pm. when the bandits waited in ambush as the public transport vehicle ran into the blockade. In a video clip released by the bandits flaunting rocket launchers and AK-47 rifles, the passengers were seen begging the Nigerian government “to do something” about their release. The 44-second video showed them speaking Arabic and Hausa, praising God for their exploit. “God is the greatest, all praise is due to God alone,” members of the banditry group said. Not only picture, this video they release is more terrifying. Bandits with grenade launcher?
