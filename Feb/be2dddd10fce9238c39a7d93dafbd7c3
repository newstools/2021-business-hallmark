He said Nigeria had a populace of intellectuals earning foreign exchange which should be leveraged on.

He said, “Nigeria exports brains and we are earning significantly from it around the world and that is the asset we need to optimise. “The interesting thing is that we can export brains from Nigeria without people leaving Nigeria. In fact, if you think about Nigeria’s unique conditions, our ability to export is not manufactured goods.”
