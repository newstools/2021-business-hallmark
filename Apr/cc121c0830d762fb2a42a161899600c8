Soldiers of the Nigerian military allegedly  attacked the residence of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, in the early hours of Monday. This was disclosed by his aide, Olayomi Koiki, who told SaharaReporters that the soldiers unleashed mayhem on the activist’s house as early as 2 am. Koiki told the online medium that it is an attack by the Nigerian government with the support of the state government. “Chief Sunday Igboho’s house came under attack this morning, 26th April 2021 around 2 am with heavy gunshots. I will be releasing more updates later in the morning,” he said. There is, however, confusion over the attack as another aide of the activist, Oladapo Salami, told the online medium that the identities of the attackers could not be ascertained, while some  residents said there was no attack. “Some people came but they were resisted. They came at exactly 1:30 am. We don’t know them, we cannot say they were soldiers. All we can say is that some people came and they were resisted. We don’t know who they were but they were resisted. We can’t say they were from the Federal or state government. But the people were resisted,” said.
