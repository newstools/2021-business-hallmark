BY EMEJA EJERE In what is believed to be part of the monetary control measure to ensure more dollar inflow and maintain forex liquidity, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has assured exporters that they will continue to have unfettered access to their export proceeds. The CBN governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele, who made the disclosure during a virtual presentation at Zenith Bank’s 2021 Export Seminar, on Tuesday, April 20, however, urged the exporters to reciprocate the good gestures of the central bank by repatriating their funds back to the country. He said that supporting greater trade within Africa and the global community is vital to the CBN’s objectives of enabling greater economic growth and creating employment opportunities for the country’s growing population. Emefiele said there is a strong push for the diversification of the Nigerian economy as the coronavirus outbreak has impacted negatively on global oil prices in 2020, which led to a huge drop in the country’s foreign exchange earnings and government revenue. The CBN boss was optimistic that the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA) will provide opportunities for the Nigerian private sector to expand into new markets and seek new export opportunities, particularly in the area of manufacturing, ICT, agriculture and financial services. He stated that the full implementation of AFCFTA would give Nigerian firms preferential access to markets in Africa with a value of about $504.17 billion in goods and $162 billion in services. Recall that the CBN had introduced several measures to encourage the inflow of forex into the country following the sharp drop in oil revenue. Some of those measures include the Naira 4 Dollar Scheme, an initiative aimed at giving incentives to senders and recipients of international money transfer in order to attract more diaspora remittances through official channels The CBN had in January 2021, announced that all Nigerian exporters who are yet to repatriate their export proceeds, will be barred from banking services effective from January 31, 2021.
