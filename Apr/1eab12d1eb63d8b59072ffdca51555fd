The Nigerian Air Force early Thursday, said one of its Alpha Jet involved in the anti-terror war against Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) has lost radar contact in Borno State. There are suggestions that the jet may have been shut down or captured by the insurgents. NAF spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, in a statement on Thursday, said the incident happened on Wednesday evening. The statement titled, ‘Nigerian Air Force Alpha-Jet Loses Radar Contact’, said though the whereabouts of the attack jet was unknown as of the time of filing this report, search and rescue efforts were ongoing. The NAF spokesman did not disclose the number of officers onboard the yet-to-be-found jet. “A Nigerian Air Force Alpha Jet has lost contact with radar in Borno State, while on interdiction mission in support of ground troops,” the statement said. “The mission was part of the ongoing counterinsurgency operations in the North East. The loss of radar contact occurred at about 5:08 pm on 31 March 2021. “Details of the whereabout of the aircraft or likely cause of contact loss are still sketchy but will be relayed to the general public as soon as they become clear.
